# CMU
## MSIN
- The career coaching at INI was invaluable in preparing my resume and making final offer decisions.
- but my time at INI and with CMU has greatly improved my ability to tackle engineering problems piecemeal. It was not a specific class, per se, so much as the time management and problem solving that comes with having to overcome so many problems the size of mountains.
