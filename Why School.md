# CMU
## MSIN
- The career coaching at INI was invaluable in preparing my resume and making final offer decisions.
- but my time at INI and with CMU has greatly improved my ability to tackle engineering problems piecemeal. It was not a specific class, per se, so much as the time management and problem solving that comes with having to overcome so many problems the size of mountains.
- The INI not only provided us with the critical skills we needed to start our company after graduating, but also with access to the network and mentorship critical to our early success.
- Today’s INI students are tomorrow’s leaders and innovators. And we’re here to help you achieve your dreams.
