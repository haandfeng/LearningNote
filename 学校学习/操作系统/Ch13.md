## Classification of malicious code
Traditional computer viruses
1. Infect the operating system boot loader
2. Infect executable files
3. Infect data file
Other malicious code
Trojan Horses, worms, rogue software, backdoor, mobile malicious code…
## Virus
Virus: a special program that can reproduce itself by attaching its code to another program. Once executed, the virus can do whatever damages onto the victim’s computer.
1. A program which can reproduce itself
2. Attaching to another program
3. Do damages
Features of virus
1. Fast to spread
2. Difficult to detect
3. Difficult to delete

## Worms
Worm: A kind of malwares that exploit system vulnerabilities for self-reproduction. Without attaching to other programs, it can  be executed independently. 

Worms can cause network congestion. 
  A worm consist of two programs:
 1. The bootstrap
 2. The worm proper
  A worm hides its existence firstly,  and then it attempts to spread its bootstrap to other machines connected to the host computer.

## Trojan Horses
- Control a victim’s computer via a specific program called the Trojan horse program.

- No self-reproduction; No voluntary infection

 - Break into a victim’s computer by hidden in software or a Web page that people voluntarily download. 

- The malware can steal the victim’s files, remotely control the victim’s computer once the downloaded Trojan horse program gets executed

Features:
- Invisibility: the primary feature; no icon, not appear in the software manager, etc.
- Autorunning
- Fraudulence: deceptive names, commonly used icons
- Automatic recovery
- Open specific ports automatically

## Mobile malicious code
New type viruses whose infected targets are mobile phones 
-- uses mobile networks and computer networks as platforms
-- uses virus messages to attack mobile phones
-- result in anomaly.
How to guard against mobile phone malicious codes
1. Check calling information and do not answer calls from abnormal numbers
2. Download files from the Internet carefully
3. Reject abnormal messages, especially messages with links
4. Turn off wireless and Bluetooth when unnecessary
5. Pay attention to safety information and take precautions

## How Viruses Work (I)
A virus is usually written in assembling languages and is inserted into a program, using a tool called a **“dropper”**

Once installed on the victim’s machine, the virus lies dormant until the infected program is executed.

Once started, it usually begins by infecting other programs on the machine and then executing its payload.

## How to spread the viruses
Put viruses in places which have frequent copy operation
After duplication
- Infect the programs on the hard disk 
- May spread on the LAN
Play as the attachment of E-mails
- Spread the virus using the list of E-mails

## Antivirus and Anti-Antivirus Techniques 
Integrity Checkers
Behavioral Checkers

Virus Avoidance
1. An operating system that offers a high degree of security 
2. Install only the software from a reliable manufacturer
3. Buy a good antivirus software package.
4. Do not click on attachments to e-mails
5. Make frequent backups of key files

Recover from the virus attack
	Shut down the computer, restart it on the safe disk and run the antivirus software

## Covert Channels

例如调节CPU的使用率，调制页率，锁定或者解锁一个预置文件
