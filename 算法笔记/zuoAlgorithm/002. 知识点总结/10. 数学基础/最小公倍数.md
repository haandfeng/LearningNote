# 最小公倍数
Least Common Multiple

---

LCM：最小公倍数(Least Common Multiple)。两个或多个整数公有的倍数叫做它们的公倍数，其中除0以外最小的一个公倍数就叫做这几个整数的最小公倍数。

$$\large
lcm(a,b) = \frac{a*b}{gcd(a,b)}
$$
$$\large
lcm(a1, a2, . . . , an) = lcm(a1, lcm(a2, a3, . . . , an))
$$

```java
// 求最小公倍数
public static int lcm(int m, int n) {
    return m * n / gcd(m, n);

}

// 为了防止溢出
private static int lcm(int m, int n) {  
    return m /gcd(m,n) * n;  
}
```

求多个数的最小公倍数:


**Problem:**   
Michael, Mark and Matthew collect coins of consecutive face values a, b and c
(each boy has only one kind of coins). The boys have to find the minimum amount of money that each of them may spend by using only their own coins.


**Solution:**   
It is easy to note that we want to find the least common multiple of the three
integers, i.e. lcm(a, b, c). 
The problem can be generalized for the lcm of exactly n integers.
There is the following relation:
$lcm(a1, a2, . . . , an) = lcm(a1, lcm(a2, a3, . . . , an))$
We simply find the lcm n times, and each step works in logarithmic time.
