xxx is a feasible and appropriate solution to alleviate xxx

From my own perspective, charging fees or taxes on those who drive car during peak hours ==does good to addressing== the issue of traffic jams,

1. People will NOT follow
	- turn to alternative ways of travel such as cars or trains/ First, the demand for air travel is highly elastic and people can easily switch to other modes of transportation,
	- which might even have more negative influence on the environment.
	- Airplane tickets would become more expensive. punishing passengers without incentivizing airlines to become more environmentally friendly. 
	- it's easier said than done. Designing and administering a carbon tax can be complex and challenging. Determining the appropriate tax rate, calculating emissions accurately, and preventing tax evasion can be difficult, which leads to potential inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of the policy
1. Damage on Economy & Concession
	- For instance, not only citizens in the aviation industry will lose their jobs due to a lower demand, other sectors such as logistics and tourism are also negatively impacted.
	- tax revenue from multiple sectors of the economy will drop, and the government will lack funding for multiple frontiers including green technology.
	- robust economy and prosperous aviation industry
	- low-income families will become even more disadvantaged in the society. / becoming further stuck in their predicament / who are usually in the lower echelons of the society.
	- In conclusion, there is no point for tons of unemployed people wandering in the street and breathing in cleaner air.
1. Will follow
	-  people are usually sensitive to financial incentives. To be more specific, a tax on fuels is much more straightforward than other measures including but not limited to public awareness campaigns, directing people to use cars only when necessary
	-  through governmental subsidies in the form of direct financial compensation or public transportation vouchers to low-income
	- higher car fuel severely damages various aspects of social economy, which leads to unemployment and even social instability

	- the government can make charging more accessible and convenient, addressing these concerns and reducing range anxiety among potential EV users.
	- EVs more affordable and attractive to consumers.
1. Will reduce pollution
	-  The revenue generated from the carbon tax could be used to invest in sustainable and renewable energy sources. This could fund research and development of (cleaner aviation) technologies, such as more fuel-efficient (planes) or the advancement of (biofuels for aircraft), ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable (aviation sector).
	- car emission has already become a major cause of smog, a form of urban pollution that impacts the quality of our life 
总结：
Therefore, we shall not raise the price of car fuel but adopt other measures to battle air pollution without impacting the life of ordinary people, including but not limited to subsidized public transportation, social infrastructure for remote working, and funding for research on electric vehicles.

By implementing these policies, the government can effectively encourage more people to switch to electric vehicles, thus reducing fossil fuel consumption and contributing to a cleaner environment

# 社会问题

开头
only supports citizens spiritually but could develop the tourism of the city to generate new income.
- 不支持
	- I don't think taxpayers' hard-earned money should be spent on impractical or inessential items and services.
- 支持
	- From statues in public parks to murals painted on the walls of government buildings, my hometown really benefits from funding the artists who created these works. The public spaces are simply more enjoyable for visitors because of the artwork.

# 艺术
作用：
- To be specific, artworks provide people a way to relax themselves. For example, a movie at the weekend or concert after our daily work could help us forget about the exhausting daily routines and keep refreshed; in addition, artworks with insights about the society, such as critical paintings or films, could invoke people to reflect on the society and seek ways to contribute to the world we live in; last but not the least, artwork, such as war memorial which would never have been done by private parties, could call upon citizens' national spirit creating a patriotic and uniting atmosphere.
- However, a support to artists could also establish new attractions of the city, which not only demonstrates the urban image to the whole nation and even the world but generates revenue from tourism to offset the initial investment.
# 科技
开头：
	since the internet provides consumers with diverse information about products and reflects their true nature.
	funding space exploration can significantly advance the development of cutting-edge technologies, ultimately making people’s lives more convenient.

Effectiveness in the conveyance of info
1. ﻿﻿﻿Fast / Easy / Accessible
	- **Up-to-Date Information:** Online reviews and recommendations are often more current, reflecting the latest trends, technologies, and market conditions.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Diverse
	- because online reviews, recommendations, and product comparisons can provide a broader perspective on various options. This approach allows us to research extensively, read about other people's experiences, and potentially discover products or solutions that we might not have considered otherwise.
	- since they provide a diverse collection of opinions. To be more specific, we can find experience from various users and compare it with our own situation, which helps us to reach a more objective decision
	- To elaborate, with the rapid development of the Internet, customers are able to obtain a large amount of information and details about the products through comments listed on the shopping websites or related videos on
	- The internet provides access to a vast array of opinions and experiences from a wide audience, helping to avoid a narrow perspective.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Professional

In contrast, those around us even might not have seen these products.

## 好句子

due to their blind trust and admiration for these influencers
be of poor quality



# Relationship

I firmly believe that a good relationship gives us a long-term support, which can consistently provide us with energy and happiness no matter our position or place in life. To elaborate, although life has its ups and downs, ==it’s the lovely relationships that create a consistent sense of well-being among us==. For example, when we hit rock bottom in our life, our families and friends can offer us a warm harbor to recover and give us the courage to move forward. Moreover, at the moment we get great achievement, it would be very upset if we don’t have anyone to share our happiness.

Admittedly, one may claim that a fulfilling career gives he a sense of self- achievement, which is a very important factor of well-being. However, for the majority of the people in the society, they are trying their best to work hard for providing a better material life for their family. Without the prerequisite - a close bond with their family, all the achievement in the business or career might become meaningless, not to mention the sense of happiness.
