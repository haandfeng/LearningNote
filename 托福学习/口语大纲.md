## Health
(1) 现在没有以前健康：
With the advancement pf technology, people have ***become more sedentary and spend a lot of time watching TV and using electronic devices, which is detrimental to their physical health.*** For example, many people prefer to stay on sofa and watch TV all day instead of engaging the in physical activities or outdoors sport. 

***Second, the modern lifestyle is characterized by a busy schedule*** , leaving little time for individuals to prepare nutritious meals. As a result, people often resort to fast food, which compromises their overall health.

(2) 现在比以前健康
***People attach greater importance to their health. It's not rare to see individuals pay great attention to keeping a balance life and work.*** For example, many people have developed the habit pf regular exercise. I go to the gym at least twice a week, which I think helps me to keep fit all the time.

Additionally, the cost of accessing the internet is cheaper, ***making it more affordable for many people.***  For example, instead of buying physical books, people can now easily download e-books or listen to audiobook in a low price.

Furthermore, online platforms offer a wide range of interactive and multimedia resources, enhancing the learning experience

e-book 代替纸质书

I believe that materials on paper will be replaced by their electronic versions. One reason for this is the convenience of e-book. Nowadays, may people enjoy reading on their cell phones which are much easier to carry around compared to heavy paper books. Additionally, e-books are usually cheaper than their counterparts because they usually have a lower price which allows people to save a lot of money when reading books. Furthermore, with special features like adjustable font-size, e-book can enhance the reading experience.
## 合作 
I prefer to work in a group. Because it can save time. When we divide tasks among group members, each person only needs to complete a part of it, which can help us finish the whole project more efficiently. 
Besides, group assignments provide a great opportunity for me to learn from others. By observing how my group mates solve problems. I can gain new insights and improve my problem-solving skills. For example, in recent group project, I learned a new approach to data analysis from one of my teammates which I would not have discovered if I had worked on the assignment alone. Overall, working in a group saves time and enhances my learning experience.
## 兼职 （practical skills）
Doing part-time job is a good way for us to ***accumulate some practical working experience*** Last year, I have an internship at a local company. It was a great experience for me, because I learned some useful knowledge and skills such as time management, teamwork, organization, customer service, and so on. All these can lay a solid foundation for my future career. Also I can make some money by doing a part-time job.
