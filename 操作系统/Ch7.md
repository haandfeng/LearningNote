# Page Replacement Introduction
Page fault forces choice 
- which page must be removed- 
- make room for incoming page
Modified page must first be saved
- unmodified just overwritten
Better not to choose an often used page
- will probably need to be brought back in soon
# Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm
Replace the page which will be referenced at the farthest point.(把最远才可能使用的page 换出去)
Optimal but impossible to implement.
