# File System Performance
Block cache
Block read ahead
Reducing Disk-Arm Motion
## Block cache
A block cache or buffer cache is a collection of blocks that logically belong on the disk, but are kept in memory to improve performance.

All of the previous paging replacement algorithms can be used to determine which block should be written when a new block is needed and the cache is full.

- Periodically, all data block should be written out.
- UNIX - system call sync forces modified blocks out to the disk immediately. e.g. update runs in background during sync every 30 seconds-
- Windows has a similar System call: FlushFileBuffer
- MS-DOS - write-through cache => all modified blocks are written immediately.
e.g. write a 1K block one character at a time
			 UNIX collect them together
			 MS-DOS 1B at a time
## Block read ahead
Get blocks into the cache before they are needed
-  help increase the hit rate
- suitable for sequential read;
- not suitable for randomly accessed
- waste disk bandwidth by reading in useless blocks and may remove potentially useful blocks from the cache;

## Reducing Disk-Arm Motion
Reading a block needs one access for the i-node and one for the block. 
(a) I-nodes placed at the start of the disk
(b) Disk divided into cylinder groups, each with its own blocks and i-nodes.

# Defragmenting Disks
Fragmentation
1. Over time, files will be created and deleted, resulting in holes on the entire disk. 
2. When a new file is created, the blocks used for it may be spread all over the disk, giving poor performance.
Solution
1. Moving files around to make them contiguous and to put all (or at least most) of the free space in one or more large contiguous regions on the disk. 
2. Windows has a program, defrag. Windows users should run it regularly, except on SSDs.
# The MS-DOS File System
FAT-based method: take table pointer word from each block and put them in an index table, FAT (File Allocation Table), in memory.

Many digital cameras and MP3 players use it.
Use a fixed-size 32 byte directory entry.

# Security
Goals and Threats:
Data confidentiality: Exposure of data
Data integrity：Tampering with data
System availability：Denial of service
## Intruders
- Intruder：people who nosing around places where they have no business
- Common categories：
	Casual prying by nontechnical users.
	Snooping by insiders.
	Attempts to make money.
	Military espionage.
## Basic of Cryptography
Encoding：C=E(P,K_E) 
Decoding：P = D(C, K_D)

Kerckhoffs’s Principle：The algorithm should all be public and the secrecy should reside in the keys.

### Secret-Key Cryptography
Mono alphabetic substitution: replace every character by a new one using a key table. 
 e.g., ATTACK -> QZZQEA

Secret-Key Cryptography is also called as Symmetric-key cryptography, for it is easy to find the decryption key given the encryption key, and vice versa.

The secret-key cryptography is relatively secure if the keys are long enough.

### Public-Key Cryptography
All users use a pair of encryption key and decryption key. The encryption key can be made public and the private decryption key is kept secret.
Given a well-chosen encryption key, it is impossible to discover the corresponding decryption key.
Step 1：Sender uses encryption key to encode the doc；
Step 2：Receiver uses decryption key to decode the doc.
Drawback：requires a lot of computation cost.
#### RSA

A fact: multiplying really big number is much easier for a computer to do than factoring really big numbers.

Step 1）Sender  publics the encryption key and uses the decryption(private) key to encode the hash value D；
Step 2）Receiver use the encryption(public) key decode D and compare it with the calculated hash value. If the value are consistent, then accept.
