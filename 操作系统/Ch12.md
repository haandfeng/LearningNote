# File System Performance
Block cache
Block read ahead
Reducing Disk-Arm Motion
## Block cache
A block cache or buffer cache is a collection of blocks that logically belong on the disk, but are kept in memory to improve performance.

All of the previous paging replacement algorithms can be used to determine which block should be written when a new block is needed and the cache is full.

- Periodically, all data block should be written out.
- UNIX - system call sync forces modified blocks out to the disk immediately. e.g. update runs in background during sync every 30 seconds-
- Windows has a similar System call: FlushFileBuffer
- MS-DOS - write-through cache => all modified blocks are written immediately.
e.g. write a 1K block one character at a time
			 UNIX collect them together
			 MS-DOS 1B at a time
## Block read ahead
Get blocks into the cache before they are needed
-  help increase the hit rate
- suitable for sequential read;
- not suitable for randomly accessed
- waste disk bandwidth by reading in useless blocks and may remove potentially useful blocks from the cache;

## Reducing Disk-Arm Motion
Reading a block needs one access for the i-node and one for the block. 
(a) I-nodes placed at the start of the disk
(b) Disk divided into cylinder groups, each with its own blocks and i-nodes.

# Defragmenting Disks
Fragmentation
1. Over time, files will be created and deleted, resulting in holes on the entire disk. 
2. When a new file is created, the blocks used for it may be spread all over the disk, giving poor performance.
Solution
1. Moving files around to make them contiguous and to put all (or at least most) of the free space in one or more large contiguous regions on the disk. 
2. Windows has a program, defrag. Windows users should run it regularly, except on SSDs.
# The MS-DOS File System
FAT-based method: take table pointer word from each block and put them in an index table, FAT (File Allocation Table), in memory.

Many digital cameras and MP3 players use it.
Use a fixed-size 32 byte directory entry.

# Security
Goals and Threats:
Data confidentiality: Exposure of data
Data integrity：Tampering with data
System availability：Denial of service
## Intruders
- Intruder：people who nosing around places where they have no business
- Common categories：
	Casual prying by nontechnical users.
	Snooping by insiders.
	Attempts to make money.
	Military espionage.
## Basic of Cryptography
Encoding：C=E(P,K_E) 
Decoding：P = D(C, K_D)

Kerckhoffs’s Principle：The algorithm should all be public and the secrecy should reside in the keys.

### Secret-Key Cryptography
Mono alphabetic substitution: replace every character by a new one using a key table. 
 e.g., ATTACK -> QZZQEA

Secret-Key Cryptography is also called as Symmetric-key cryptography, for it is easy to find the decryption key given the encryption key, and vice versa.

The secret-key cryptography is relatively secure if the keys are long enough.

### Public-Key Cryptography
All users use a pair of encryption key and decryption key. The encryption key can be made public and the private decryption key is kept secret.
Given a well-chosen encryption key, it is impossible to discover the corresponding decryption key.
Step 1：Sender uses encryption key to encode the doc；
Step 2：Receiver uses decryption key to decode the doc.
Drawback：requires a lot of computation cost.
#### RSA

A fact: multiplying really big number is much easier for a computer to do than factoring really big numbers.

What are the factors of the composite number 1600000000000000229500000000000003170601?
80000000000000001239 and 20000000000000002559!!!

### Digital Signatures

### ![[Pasted image 20231229104711.png]]
Step 1）Sender  publics the encryption key and uses the decryption(private) key to encode the hash value D；
Step 2）Receiver use the encryption(public) key decode D and compare it with the calculated hash value. If the value are consistent, then accept.


## Authentication
Basic rules：
	Unique authentication
	Be accomplished before users get access to the system

Three principles：
	Something the user knows
	Something the user has 
	Something the user is
### Authentication Using Passwords

![[Pasted image 20231229110531.png]]
(a) A successful login.
(b) Login rejected after name is entered.
(c) Login rejected after name and password are typed.

The use of salt to defeat pre computation of encrypted passwords
![[Pasted image 20231229110617.png|300]]
Update passwords periodically
### Authentication Using a Physical Object
To check for some physical object users have, 
e.g. magnetic stripe cards, magcards, IC cards

### Authentication Using Biometrics

## Insider Attacks
### Logic Bombs
Logic bomb: Programmers in companies may hide bugs in the programs on purpose, 
 e.g., a device which does nothing as long as the programmer feeds it its daily password while goes off after the programmer gets suddenly fired and not feeds it the next day.
### Trap Doors
Trap door: a piece of additional code inserted into the program so as to bypass some normal check.
![[Pasted image 20231229111744.png]]
(a) Normal code. (b) Code with a trap door inserted.
###  Login Spoofing(欺骗)
A way of stealing users’ login names and passwords by providing a similar but fake login window

The fake login window looks amazingly the same as the true one!
