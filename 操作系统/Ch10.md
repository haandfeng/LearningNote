# File Management
Must store large amounts of data
	Gigabytes -> terabytes -> petabytes
Stored information must survive the termination of the process using it
	Lifetime can be seconds to years
	Must have some way of finding it
Multiple processes must be able to access the information concurrently
Solution: Store information on disk or other external media in units called files.
## Naming files
Important to be able to find files after they’re created
Every file has at least one name
Name can be
	“foo.c”, “my photo”, 
	“4502”, 
Case may or may not matter (Depends on the file system)
Name may include information about the file’s contents, e.g.,
 The name should make it easy to figure out what’s in it;   
 Computer may use part of the name to determine the file type
