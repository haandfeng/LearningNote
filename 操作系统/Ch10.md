# Power Management

The most common method to save battery is to design the devices to have multiple states: 
  ***On, Sleep, and Off.***

Running at full clock speed. 
Cutting voltage by two cuts clock speed by two and power consumption by four.
The user can run longer on a given battery by accepting some quality degradation.
- Abandon the color information and display the video in black and white.
- Use radio link to send task to other devices.
- Trading image quality to reduce the transmission overload.



# File Management
Must store large amounts of data
	Gigabytes -> terabytes -> petabytes
Stored information must survive the termination of the process using it
	Lifetime can be seconds to years
	Must have some way of finding it
Multiple processes must be able to access the information concurrently
Solution: Store information on disk or other external media in units called files.
## Naming files
Important to be able to find files after they’re created
Every file has at least one name
Name can be
	“foo.c”, “my photo”, 
	“4502”, 
Case may or may not matter (Depends on the file system)
Name may include information about the file’s contents, e.g.,
 The name should make it easy to figure out what’s in it;   
 Computer may use part of the name to determine the file type

## File Types
![[Pasted image 20231228004133.png|375]]

(a) An executable file   (b) An archive

## File Access
Sequential access
	read all bytes/records from the beginning
	cannot jump around
	convenient when medium was magnetic tape
Random access
	bytes/records read in any order
	essential for database systems



## File Attributes
Operating systems associate extra information with each file, called file attributes.

## Directories
File systems have directories or folders to keep track of files.
1. A single-level directory has one directory (root) containing all the files.
2. A two-level directory has a root directory and user directories.
3. A hierarchical directory has a root directory and arbitrary number of subdirectories.
### A single level directory system
![[Pasted image 20231228100513.png]]
A single level directory system
contains 4 files
owned by 3 different people, A, B, and C
 Common in early personal computers.
### Two-level Directory Systems

Letters indicate owners of the directories and files
