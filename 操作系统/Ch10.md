# Power Management 
![[Pasted image 20231228001550.png]]
The most common method to save battery is to design the devices to have multiple states: 
  ***On, Sleep, and Off.***
  ![[Pasted image 20231228001711.png]]
Running at full clock speed. 
Cutting voltage by two cuts clock speed by two and power consumption by four.
The user can run longer on a given battery by accepting some quality degradation.
- Abandon the color information and display the video in black and white.
- Use radio link to send task to other devices.
- Trading image quality to reduce the transmission overload.



# File Management
Must store large amounts of data
	Gigabytes -> terabytes -> petabytes
Stored information must survive the termination of the process using it
	Lifetime can be seconds to years
	Must have some way of finding it
Multiple processes must be able to access the information concurrently
Solution: Store information on disk or other external media in units called files.
## Naming files
Important to be able to find files after they’re created
Every file has at least one name
Name can be
	“foo.c”, “my photo”, 
	“4502”, 
Case may or may not matter (Depends on the file system)
Name may include information about the file’s contents, e.g.,
 The name should make it easy to figure out what’s in it;   
 Computer may use part of the name to determine the file type
## File Structure
![[Pasted image 20231228004049.png]]

## File Types
![[Pasted image 20231228004133.png|375]]

(a) An executable file   (b) An archive

## File Access
Sequential access
	read all bytes/records from the beginning
	cannot jump around
	convenient when medium was magnetic tape
Random access
	bytes/records read in any order
	essential for database systems



## File Attributes
Operating systems associate extra information with each file, called file attributes.

## Directories
File systems have directories or folders to keep track of files.
1. A single-level directory has one directory (root) containing all the files.
2. A two-level directory has a root directory and user directories.
3. A hierarchical directory has a root directory and arbitrary number of subdirectories.
### A single level directory system
![[Pasted image 20231228100513.png]]
A single level directory system
contains 4 files
owned by 3 different people, A, B, and C
 Common in early personal computers.
### Two-level Directory Systems
![[Pasted image 20231228100541.png]]
Letters indicate owners of the directories and files

### Hierarchical Directory Systems
![[Pasted image 20231228100626.png]]
All modern file systems are organized in this manner.

### A UNIX directory tree
![[Pasted image 20231228101555.png|450]]
### Path
Two different methods are used to specify file names in a directory tree:
1. Absolute path name consists of the path from the root directory to the file.  e.g., cp /usr/ast/mailbox /usr/ast/mailbox.bak
2. Relative path name consists of the path from the current directory (working directory). e.g,   cp ../lib/dictionary  => cp /usr/lib/dictionary

The path name are different in different systems:
- Winodws: \usr\ast\mailbox
- UNIX: /usr/ast/mailbox
- MULTICS: >usr>ast>mailbox

“.” and “..” are two special entries in the file system.
- Dot (.) refers to the current directory (working directory). 
- Dot dot (..) refers to its parent.
## File System Layout
File system layout:
- MBR (Master Boot Record) is used to boot the computer.
- The partition table gives the starting and ending addresses of each partition.
- Boot block: read in by the MBR program when the system is booted.
- Super block: contains the key parameters about the file system.(迅速找到空闲磁盘块)
- Free blocks information（如位视图）
- I-nodes tells all about the file.
- Root directory
- Directories and files

## File Allocation
### Contiguous Allocation: 
   store each file as contiguous block of data.

![[Pasted image 20231228105517.png]]
Contiguous Allocation
Advantages:  
	Simple to implement;
	Read performance is excellent.
Disadvantages:  
	Disk fragmentation
	The maximum file size must be known when file is created. 
Example: CD-ROMs, DVDs
### Linked List Allocation:
keep linked list of disk blocks
![[Pasted image 20231228162225.png]]
Slow random access speed
The amount of data in a block is not a power of 2
#### Linked List Allocation using an index
Take table pointer word from each block and put them in an index table, FAT (File Allocation Table) in memory.
Advantages?
	The entire block is available for data
	Stored in memory, fast
Drawbacks?
	Occupies a large amount of memory.
	For 200-GB disk, the  table will take up 600M or 800 M memory.

## File Control Block
- A file is composed of File Control Block（FCB) and File body。
- FCB stores the property information of the file
	e.g., name, path, access control information。
- In Unix， FCB is implemented by i-node
