# Directories 
- When a file is opened, the file system uses the path name to locate the directory entry. 
Directory: provides information needed to find the disk blocks.
1. disk address of the entire file (contiguous blocks)
2. the number of first block (linked list)
3. the number of I-node (I-node)
Where to store attributes? In directory or I-node?


## Two methods to store attributes

1. Fixed size entries, disk addresses and attributes in directory entry (MS-DOS/Windows) 
2. Directory in which each entry just refers to an I-node (UNIX)

## Handling long file names in a directory:
1. Fixed-length names (Waste space)
2. In-line (When a file is removed, a variable-sized gap is introduced., see(a))
3. Heap (The heap management needs extra effort, see (b))

## How to search files in each directory?
Linearly  (slow)
Hash table  (faster lookup but more complex administration)
Cache the results of searches

# Shared files
- A shared file is used to allow a file to appear in several directories.
- The connection between a directory and the shared file is called a link. The file system is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
