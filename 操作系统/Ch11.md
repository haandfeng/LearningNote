# Directories 
- When a file is opened, the file system uses the path name to locate the directory entry. 
Directory: provides information needed to find the disk blocks.
1. disk address of the entire file (contiguous blocks)
2. the number of first block (linked list)
3. the number of I-node (I-node)
Where to store attributes? In directory or I-node?
