# Directories 
- When a file is opened, the file system uses the path name to locate the directory entry. 
Directory: provides information needed to find the disk blocks.
1. disk address of the entire file (contiguous blocks)
2. the number of first block (linked list)
3. the number of I-node (I-node)
Where to store attributes? In directory or I-node?


## Two methods to store attributes
![[Pasted image 20231228183108.png]]
1. Fixed size entries, disk addresses and attributes in directory entry (MS-DOS/Windows) 
2. Directory in which each entry just refers to an I-node (UNIX)

## Handling long file names in a directory:
1. Fixed-length names (Waste space)
2. In-line (When a file is removed, a variable-sized gap is introduced., see(a))
3. Heap (The heap management needs extra effort, see (b))

## How to search files in each directory?
Linearly  (slow)
Hash table  (faster lookup but more complex administration)
Cache the results of searches

# Shared files
- A shared file is used to allow a file to appear in several directories.
- The connection between a directory and the shared file is called a link. The file system is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Problem: 
If directories contain disk address, a copy of the disk address will have to be made in directory B.  What if A or B append the file, the new blocks will only appear in one directory.

Solution:	
1. Do not list disk block addresses in directories but in a little data structure.   e.g., i-nodes
2. Create a new file of type link which contains the path name of the file to which it is linked  => symbolic linking

# Virtual File Systems
1. 向上层用户进程提供统一标准的系统调用接口，屏蔽了底层具体文件系统的实现差异
2. 要求下层文件系统必须实现某些规定的函数功能 如open/read/write
3. 每打开一个文件，VFS就在主存中新建一个vnode，用统一的数据结构表示文件，无论该文件存储在哪个文件系统。 ***vnode 只在主存中，inode既会被调入主存也会在外存***  vnode保存了具体的 函数指针
Same API for different types of file systems
	Separates file-system generic operations from implementation details 
	Syscalls program to VFS API rather than specific FS interface 
Very flexible use cases: 
	User files remote and system files local?
	Boot from USB? Network?

# Disk space management
Strategies for storing an n byte file:
1. Allocate n consecutive bytes of disk space
	If the file grows it will have to be moved on the disk,  it is an expensive operation and causes external fragmentation. 
2. Allocate a number [n/k] blocks of size k bytes each       
   Blocks do not need to be adjacent.
## How to determine block size？
When block size increase, disk space utilization decrease 
	Internal fragmentation, space efficiency decrease
	
When block size decrease, data transfer rate decrease（文件会跨越很多块）
	Time efficiency decrease
	
usual size k = 512bytes, 1k (UNIX), or 2k

## Keeping Track of Free Blocks 
### Use bit-map
Free blocks ->1,  Allocated blocks ->  0

A disk with (n) blocks requires a bitmap with (n) bits
Free blocks are represented by 1's
Allocated blocks represented by 0's

16GB disk has 2^24 1KB（block的数量） and requires 2^24 bits => 2048 blocks
Using a linked list = 2^24/255 = 65793 blocks. (1个block 1kb可以存255个free port和一个pointer)

### Use linked list
With 1 KB block and 32-bit disk block number.

Each block holds as many free disk block numbers as will fit. => 1024 * 8/32 = 256 disk block numbers => 255 free blocks (and) 1 next block pointer.

# File System Backup
Backups are made to handle: recover from disaster or stupidity.
Considerations of backups
- Entire or part of  the file system
- **Incremental dumps**: dump (转储)only files that have changed 
- Compression
- Backup an active file system
- Security

## Two strategies for dumping a disk:
1. Physical dump: starts at block 0 to the last one.
	Advantages: simple and fast
	Disadvantages: backup everything
2. Logical dump: starts at one or more specified directories and recursively dumps all files and directories found that have changed since some given base date.

Bit maps used by the logical dumping algorithm 
(After 4 phases, the dump is complete)

# File System Consistency
Most OS have a utility program, called a file system checker, to test the consistency of a file system.
E.g.,  fsck in UNIX, sfc in Windows

## Two types of consistency checks can be made: 
### block consistency
Block consistency:
1. Build two tables with a counter per block, initially set to 0 , The counters in the first table keep track of  number of times each block is present in a file. The counters of the second table record the number of times in free list, 
2. Then, the program reads all the i-nodes and uses the i-nodes to build a list of all blocks used in the files (incrementing file counter as each block is read).
3. Check free list or bit map to find all blocks not in use (increment free list counter for each block in free list).

### file consistency
![[Pasted image 20231228214217.png]]
File system states
(a) consistent
(b) missing block – add it to the free list
(c) duplicate block in free list – rebuild the free list
(d) duplicate data block – copy the block to a free block
